Hey hey hey!

Welcome to my github page!

A little about me, I'm a new web developer and recent graduate of the Launch Academy bootcamp through Ruby on Rails curriculum.

In another lifetime I had the job security of an improviser and sketch writer along with the artistic freedom as the Assistant Treasurer for the Town of Belmont (wait...strike that, reverse it).

I have experience using React, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Foundation, Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, RSpec, Capybara, Sass, AWS, and CarrierWave.

I'm currently looking for my first job as a junior web developer at a company where I can continue learning new languages and gain more indepth knowledge in the languagues, databases, and software that I've played around in.

Until then, I will be developing my breakable toy that allows freelance writers to schedule deadlines for their writing projects and track their progress.
